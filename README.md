### Hi there 👋

I'm a dev that's excited about all things tech 🤩 Here are some of my favorite nuggets on the internet: 

* [Opencode](https://opencode.ai/) paired up with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)
* [Neovim](https://neovim.io) and all vim keybinding tools like:
  * [Vimium C](https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c) for your browser
  * [Shortcat](https://shortcat.app/) for your mac
  * [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot) for your Spotify
* [TimeWarrior](https://timewarrior.net/) for time tracking
* [Aerospace](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide) for getting that i3-like tiling window manager experience on a mac
  * Pairs nicely with [Sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar) - check out [my dots](https://github.com/bogdan-calapod/dotfiles) if you wanna see how I use it!
* [presenterm](https://github.com/mfontanini/presenterm) for making cool presentations in the terminal
* [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) and [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) for cool resource management
* Need a scale but have just a mac ? [Check this out](https://github.com/KrishKrosh/TrackWeight)
